Since its inception in 2009, Node.js has grown into one of the most popular runtime environments for executing JavaScript code outside the browser. Built on Chrome\'s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables developers to create scalable, high-performance applications using JavaScript on both the client and server sides. In this article, we’ll explore what makes Node.js unique, its core features, and why it’s a go-to choice for modern web development.\r\nNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. Unlike traditional server-side languages like PHP or Java, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient. This architecture is particularly well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat apps, online gaming, and streaming services, where low latency and high concurrency are critical.\r\nNode.js has become a cornerstone of modern web development, offering a powerful and efficient way to build scalable, real-time applications. Its event-driven architecture, extensive package ecosystem, and cross-platform compatibility make it a favorite among developers worldwide. Whether you’re building a small project or a large-scale enterprise application, Node.js provides the tools and flexibility needed to bring your ideas to life. As the JavaScript ecosystem continues to evolve, Node.js will undoubtedly remain a key player in the world of server-side development.', 'Development', 1, '2025-03-01 08:03:25'),

In this article, we’ll explore the evolution of JavaScript development, its key features, and the modern tools and frameworks that make it indispensable for developers.\nJavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days while he was working at Netscape. Initially, it was designed to make web pages more dynamic and interactive. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, thanks to its widespread adoption and the contributions of the developer community.', 'development', 9, '2025-03-01 09:42:22');
